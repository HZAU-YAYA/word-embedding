rice brittle culm nbr bcnbr encodes a classical dynamin osdrpnbrb essential for proper secondary cell wall synthesis	nbr	planta	division of plant sciences national institute of agrobiological sciences tsukuba ibaraki japan 	 brittle culm mutants found in gramineae crops are suitable materials to study the mechanism of secondary cell wall formation through positional cloning we have identified a gene responsible for the brittle culm phenotype in rice brittle culm nbr bcnbr bcnbr encodes a member of the classical dynamin protein family a family known to function widely in membrane dynamics the bcnbr mutation resulted in reductions of nbr in cellulose contents in culms leaves and roots while other cell wall components remained unaffected reductions of cell wall thickness and birefringence were observed in both fiber sclerenchyma and parenchymal cells together with blurring of the wall s layered structures from promoter-gus analyses it was suggested that bcnbr expression is directly correlated with active secondary cell wall synthesis these results suggest that bcnbr is tightly involved in the synthesis of cellulose and is essential for proper secondary cell wall construction 	bcnbr osdrpnbrb
the rice dynamin-related protein drpnbrb mediates membrane trafficking and thereby plays a critical role in secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis	nbr	plant j	state key laboratory of plant genomics and national center for plant gene research institute of genetics and developmental biology chinese academy of sciences beijing nbr china 	membrane trafficking between the plasma membrane pm and intracellular compartments is an important process that regulates the deposition and metabolism of cell wall polysaccharides dynamin-related proteins drps which function in membrane tubulation and vesiculation are closely associated with cell wall biogenesis however the molecular mechanisms by which drps participate in cell wall formation are poorly understood here we report the functional characterization of brittle culmnbr bcnbr a gene encoding osdrpnbrb consistent with the expression of bcnbr in mechanical tissues the bcnbr mutation reduces mechanical strength which results from decreased cellulose content and altered secondary wall structure osdrpnbrb one of three members of the drpnbr subfamily in rice oryza sativa l was identified as an authentic membrane-associated dynamin via in vitro biochemical analyses subcellular localization of fluorescence-tagged osdrpnbrb and several compartment markers in protoplast cells showed that this protein not only lies at the pm and the clathrin-mediated vesicles but also is targeted to the trans-golgi network tgn an fmnbr uptake assay in transgenic plants that express green fluorescent protein-tagged osdrpnbrb verified its involvement in an endocytic pathway bcnbr mutation and overexpression altered the abundance of cellulose synthase catalytic subunit nbr oscesanbr in the pm and in the endomembrane systems all of these findings lead us to conclude that osdrpnbrb participates in the endocytic pathway probably as well as in post-golgi membrane trafficking mutation of osdrpnbrb disturbs the membrane trafficking that is essential for normal cellulose biosynthesis of the secondary cell wall thereby leading to inferior mechanical properties in rice plants 	bcnbr osdrpnbrb oscesanbr bcnbr bcnbr
map-based cloning of a novel rice cytochrome pnbr gene cypnbr that confers resistance to two different classes of herbicides	nbr	plant mol biol	college of agriculture and biotechnology zhejiang university hangzhou nbr zhejiang china 	development of hybrid rice has greatly contributed to increased yields during the past three decades two bentazon-lethal mutants nbrs and norinnbrm are being utilized in developing new hybrid rice systems when the male sterile lines are developed in such a mutant background the problem of fnbr seed contamination by self-seeds from the sterile lines can be solved by spraying bentazon at seedling stage we first determined the sensitivity of the mutant plants to bentazon both mutants showed symptoms to bentazon starting from nbr mg l which was about nbr-fold lower than the sensitivity threshold of their wild-type controls in addition both mutants were sensitive to sulfonylurea-type herbicides the locus for the mutant phenotype is bel for nbrs and bsl for norinnbrm tests showed that the two loci are allelic to each other the two genes were cloned by map-based cloning interestingly both mutant alleles had a single-base deletion which was confirmed by pcr-rflp the two loci are renamed bel a for bel and bel b for bsl the wild-type bel gene encodes a novel cytochrome pnbr monooxgenase named cypnbr analysis of the mutant protein sequence also revealed the reason for bel a being slightly tolerant than bel b introduction of the wild-type bel gene rescued the bentazon- and sulfonylurea-sensitive phenotype of bel a mutant on the other hand expression of antisense bel in wnbrs induced a mutant phenotype based on these results we conclude that the novel cytochrome pnbr monooxygenase cypnbr encoded by bel confers resistance to two different classes of herbicides 	bel cypnbr bsl
a novel rice cytochrome pnbr gene cypnbr confers tolerance to acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides in rice and arabidopsis	nbr	plant physiol	agrogenomics research center national institute of agrobiological sciences	target-site and non-target-site herbicide tolerance are caused by the prevention of herbicide binding to the target enzyme and the reduction to a non-lethal dose of herbicide reaching the target enzyme respectively there is little information on the molecular mechanisms involved in non-target-site herbicide tolerance although it poses the greater threat in the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds and could potentially be useful for the production of herbicide-tolerant crops because it is often involved in tolerance to multi-herbicides bispyribac sodium bs is a herbicide that inhibits the activity of acetolactate synthase als rice of the indica variety show bs tolerance while japonica rice varieties are bs sensitive map-based cloning and complementation tests revealed that a novel cytochrome pnbr monooxygenase cypnbr is involved in bs tolerance interestingly bs tolerance was correlated with cypnbr mrna levels in transgenic plants of rice and arabidopsis moreover arabidopsis overexpressing cypnbr showed tolerance to bensulfuron-methyl bsm which belongs to a different class of als-inhibiting herbicides suggesting that cypnbr can metabolize bs and bsm to a compound with reduced phytotoxicity on the other hand we showed that the cytochrome pnbr monooxygenase cypnbr which has been reported to confer bsm tolerance is barely involved if at all in bs tolerance suggesting that the cypnbr enzyme has different herbicide specificities compared to cypnbr thus the cypnbr gene is a potentially useful genetic resource in the field of weed control herbicide development and molecular breeding in broad range of crop species 	bel cypnbr bsl cypnbr
